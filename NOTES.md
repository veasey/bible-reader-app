# Notes

If there is a better place to keep these, let me know.

## Todo

There is not order to these todos

- [x] have a clear selected book option
- [x] have a clear query button
- [x] have a research query option
  - [x] if changing book with a query in, search that book for the query.
  - [x] if query empty, get 1st verse
- [ ] Display entire chapter (as an option)
- [ ] Styling
- [ ] About / Contact Page (link to this github repo)
- [ ] Pagination
  - [ ] Show Next and Prev buttons
  - [ ] verse result pagination
- [ ] Show a Random Verse button
- [ ] Session Var, remember where user left off.
   - [ ] Show Random verse by default, if no session found.
- [ ] select alt translation (just add a NLT etc, just to test and adapt for it)
- [ ] /x-x-x paths, so can hyperlink results
  - [ ] When clicking Book or Chapter in result, take to top of that result list.

## ideas

2. On the Menus, when you click on a chapter on the menu, you should display all verses of the selectedÂ chapter
