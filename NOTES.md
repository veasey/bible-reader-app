# Notes

If there is a better place to keep these, let me know.

## Todo

There is not order to these todos

- [ ] Display entire chapter (as an option)
- [ ] Styling
- [ ] About / Contact Page (link to this github repo)
- [ ] Show Next and Prev buttons
- [ ] Show a Random Verse button
- [ ] Session Var, remember where user left off.
   - [ ] Show Random verse by default, if no session found.
- [ ] select alt translation (just add a NLT etc, just to test and adapt for it)
- [ ] /x-x-x paths, so can hyperlink results
  - [ ] When clicking Book or Chapter in result, take to top of that result list.

## ideas
