# Notes

If there is a better place to keep these, let me know.

## Todo

- [X] Loading
- [ ] Book Select Menu
- [ ] Styling
- [ ] About / Contact Page (link to this github repo)

## Bugs

- [x] Error with No results
- [x] Error with books with a number prefix (i.e. 2 Samuel)
- [x] Chapter Select
- [ ] Chapter Select starting on 1, instead of null
- [ ] verse select

## ideas

1. You can improve the search with dropdown list to select a chapter rather than phrases. After choosing the chapter then another dropdown or search bar to choose a specific verse.
2. On the Menus, when you click on a chapter on the menu, you should display all verses of the selectedÂ chapter
