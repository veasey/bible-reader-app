# Notes

If there is a better place to keep these, let me know.

## Todo

There is not order to these todos

- [X] Loading
- [x] Book Select Menu
  - [ ] get selection buttons to select Verse
  - [ ] changing to new book, defaults to verse 1
- [ ] Display entire chapter (as an option)
- [ ] Styling
- [ ] About / Contact Page (link to this github repo)
- [ ] Show Next and Prev buttons
- [ ] Show a Random Verse button
- [ ] Session Var, remember where user left off.
   - [ ] Show Random verse by default, if no session found.
- [ ] select alt translation (just add a NLT etc, just to test and adapt for it)

## ideas

1. You can improve the search with dropdown list to select a chapter rather than phrases. After choosing the chapter then another dropdown or search bar to choose a specific verse.
2. On the Menus, when you click on a chapter on the menu, you should display all verses of the selectedÂ chapter
