# React Bible Reader

Simple bible reader project.

## History

Originally this was a Metro project, to work on Android and IOS as well, but it was getting unwieldy. This is purely web based, and will cross that bridge when I come to it. In addition there was no need for mobile apps in my portfolio professionally.

## Translations

Translations were converted to JSON via custom script:
